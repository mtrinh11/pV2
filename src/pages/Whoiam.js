                <p> I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, but immigrated to The United States before I could form any lasting memories. 
                    I grew up in the San Fernando Valley in Southern California where I learned the meaning of "heat wave". 
                    I went to Anatola Elementary and Birmingham Community Charter High School where I worked hard enough 
                    to gain acceptance to UC Berkeley.
                    <br/><br/>
                    At UC Berkeley I studied a variety of subjects, and graduated with a BA in Political Economics with a concentration
                    in International Trade. There I took my first coding class and used Snap!, a graphical programming language. I found that I
                    enjoyed coding so I continued taking computer science classes. Next, I learned python and java. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    After graduating from UC Berkeley, I worked in entertainment at one of the Big Four talent agencies following a love
                    I found for entertainment after doing improv comedy in college. 
                    There I worked in music and comedy touring. Going to shows big and small varying in genre and themes was a 
                    great experience. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Unfortunately, COVID-19 sent us into lockdown and many other changes. Upon much reflection, I decided I'd pursue the
                    adjacent passion I discovered in college: coding.
